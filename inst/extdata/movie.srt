1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,192
This is the Asgardian

2
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,736
refugee vessel Statesman.

3
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,778
We are under assault.

4
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,951
I repeat, we are under assault.

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,659
The engines are dead, life support failing.

6
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,791
Requesting aid from any vessel within range.

7
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:46,954
We are 22 jump points out of Asgard.

8
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,582
Our crew is made up of Asgardian families.

9
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,167
We have very few soldiers here.

10
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:54,210
This is not a war craft.

11
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,296
I repeat, this is not a war craft.

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,771
Hear me and rejoice.

13
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,819
You have had the privilege

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,575
of being saved by the Great Titan.

15
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,751
You may think this is suffering.

16
00:01:27,963 --> 00:01:28,953
No.

17
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,340
It is salvation.

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:39,931
Universal scales tip toward balance

19
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,758
because of your sacrifice.

20
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,806
Smile.

21
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,147
For even in death,

22
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,691
you have become Children of Thanos.

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,163
I know what it's like to lose.

24
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,298
To feel so desperately that you're right...

25
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,794
yet to fail, nonetheless.

26
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,511
It's frightening.

27
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,813
Turns the legs to jelly.

28
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,060
But I ask you, to what end?

29
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,072
Dread it, run from it...

30
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,655
destiny arrives all the same.

31
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,703
And now, it's here.

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,122
Or should I say...

33
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,951
I am.

34
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,757
You talk too much.

35
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,510
The Tesseract.

36
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,005
Or your brother's head.

37
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:09,054
I assume you have a preference.

38
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,601
Oh, I do.

39
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,063
Kill away.

40
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,451
All right, stop!

41
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,963
We don't have the Tesseract.

42
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:38,966
It was destroyed on Asgard.

43
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,639
You really are the worst brother.

44
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,562
I assure you, brother...

45
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,697
the sun will shine on us again.

46
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,653
Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

47
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:10,786
Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian.

48
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,162
And for another...

49
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,749
we have a Hulk.

50
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,850
Let him have his fun.

51
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,612
All fathers...

52
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,735
let the dark magic flow through me one last...

53
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,660
time.

54
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,961
That was a mistake.

55
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,515
No!

56
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,272
You're going to die for that.

57
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:10,652
Shh.

58
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,285
My humble personage...

59
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,001
bows before your grandeur.

60
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,512
No other being has ever had the might...

61
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,593
nay, the nobility...

62
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:36,686
to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones.

63
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:44,565
The universe lies within your grasp.

64
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:26,561
There are two more stones on Earth.

65
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:31,524
Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

66
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,237
Father, we will not fail you.

67
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,902
If I might interject.

68
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:39,370
If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide.

69
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,876
I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

70
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,376
If you consider failure experience.

71
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,208
I consider experience experience.

72
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,918
Almighty Thanos...

73
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:55,886
I, Loki, prince of Asgard...

74
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:00,895
Odinson...

75
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:06,730
the rightful king of Jotunheim...

76
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,228
god of mischief...

77
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,606
do hereby pledge to you...

78
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,903
my undying fidelity.

79
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,956
Undying?

80
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,425
You should choose your words more carefully.

81
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,943
You...

82
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,662
will never be...

83
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,457
a god.

84
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,794
No!

85
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,271
No resurrections this time.

86
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:59,050
No. Loki.

87
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,839
Seriously, you don't have any money?

88
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:43,970
Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

89
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:45,430
I'll tell the guys at the deli.

90
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,469
Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

91
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,479
Oh. Wait, wait, wait. I think I have 200.

92
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,639
Dollars?

93
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,149
- Rupees.  - Which is?

94
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,146
Uh, buck and a half.

95
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,527
What do you want?

96
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,318
I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

97
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,752
Thanos is coming.

98
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,539
He's coming.

99
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,131
Who?

100
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,099
Slow down, slow down. I'll spell it out for you.

101
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,180
You're totally rambling.

102
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,310
- No, I'm not.  - You lost me.

103
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,516
Look, you know how you're having a dream,

104
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,726
and in the dream you gotta pee.

105
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:35,893
- Yeah.  - Okay.

106
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,186
And then you're like, "Oh, my God."

107
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,441
"There's no bathrooms. What am I gonna do? "

108
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,521
- "Oh, someone's watching. "  - Right.

109
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:40,606
"Oh, I'm gonna go in my pants. "

110
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,781
And then you wake up and in real life

111
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:42,904
you actually have to pee.

112
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,984
- Yes.  - Yeah.

113
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,194
- Okay.  - Everybody has that.

114
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,078
Right, that's the point I'm trying to make.

115
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:51,409
Apropos of that, last night I dreamt we had a kid.

116
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,210
It was so real.

117
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:54,920
We named him after your eccentric uncle.

118
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:55,996
Uh, what was his name?

119
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,416
- Right.  - Morgan! Morgan.

120
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,209
- So you woke up...  - Naturally.

121
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,968
and thought that we were...

122
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,219
- Expecting.  - Yeah.

123
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,342
- Yes?  - No.

124
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,798
I had a dream about it. It was so real.

125
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,307
If you wanted to have a kid...

126
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,388
you wouldn't have done that.

127
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,020
I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing.

128
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,517
It's just a housing unit for nanoparticles.

129
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:15,102
You're not helping your case, okay?

130
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,309
No, this is detachable. It's not a...

131
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,943
You don't need that.

132
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,360
I know, I had the surgery.

133
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,483
I'm just trying to protect us...

134
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,314
and future usses and that's it.

135
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,074
Just in case there's a monster in the closet.

136
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,072
- Instead of, you know...  - Shirts.

137
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,204
You know me so well.

138
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,998
- God.  - You finish all my sentences.

139
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,409
You should have shirts in your closet.

140
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:35,786
Yeah.

141
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,338
You know what there should be? No more surprises.

142
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,669
We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight.

143
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,967
Show off this Harry Winston.

144
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,386
Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever.

145
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,591
I should promise you.

146
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,051
- Yes.  - I will.

147
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,555
Thank you.

148
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,806
Tony Stark.

149
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,973
I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me.

150
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,568
Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

151
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,603
I'm sorry, you giving out tickets to something?

152
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:03,109
We need your help.

153
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,490
It's not overselling it to say that

154
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,112
the fate of the universe is at stake.

155
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,739
And who's "We"?

156
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,492
Hey, Tony.

157
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,698
Bruce.

158
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,491
- Pepper.  - Hi.

159
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,121
Oh. You okay?

160
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,087
At the dawn of the universe,

161
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,134
there was nothing. Then...

162
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,799
Boom.

163
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,682
The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals...

164
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,686
hurtling across the virgin universe.

165
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,267
These Infinity Stones

166
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:39,270
each control an essential aspect of existence.

167
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,397
Space.

168
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,691
Reality.

169
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,486
Power.

170
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,863
Soul.

171
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,157
Mind.

172
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,323
And Time.

173
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,167
Tell me his name again.

174
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,468
Thanos.

175
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:07,923
He's a plague, Tony.

176
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,880
He invades planets. He takes what he wants.

177
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,266
He wipes out half the population.

178
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,059
He sent Loki.

179
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,600
The attack on New York, that's him.

180
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,307
This is it.

181
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,475
What's our timeline?

182
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,777
No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones.

183
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:24,936
That already makes him

184
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,567
the strongest creature in the whole universe.

185
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,075
If he gets his hands on all six stones, Tony...

186
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,242
He could destroy life

187
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,321
on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

188
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,371
Did you seriously just say "Hitherto undreamt of"?

189
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,583
Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

190
00:14:37,752 --> 00:14:39,243
Is that what it is?

191
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,918
I'm going to allow that.

192
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,592
If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just

193
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,135
stick this one down a garbage disposal?

194
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,212
No can do.

195
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,098
We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone with our lives.

196
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,383
And I swore off dairy...

197
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,060
but then Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me.

198
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,603
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.  - Not bad.

199
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,139
A bit chalky.

200
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:01,852
A Hunk of Hulk of Burning Fudge is our favorite.

201
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,142
- That's a thing?  - Whatever.

202
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:04,397
Point is, things change.

203
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,404
Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change.

204
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,607
And this stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

205
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,690
Yeah, so conversely,

206
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,651
it may also be his best chance against us.

207
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,202
Well, if we don't do our jobs.

208
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,278
What is your job exactly?

209
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:16,989
Besides making balloon animals.

210
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,743
Protecting your reality, douchebag.

211
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,329
Okay, guys. Could we table this discussion right now?

212
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,372
The fact is we have this stone.

213
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,752
We know where it is.

214
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:29,468
Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone...

215
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,344
and we have to find him now.

216
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,551
Yeah, that's the thing.

217
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,631
What do you mean?

218
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,975
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder.

219
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,177
He's offline.

220
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,512
- What?  - Yeah.

221
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,681
Tony, you lost another super-bot?

222
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:44,016
I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

223
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,650
Who could find Vision then?

224
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:49,646
Shit.

225
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,314
Probably Steve Rogers.

226
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,653
Oh, great.

227
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:54,326
Maybe.

228
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,944
But...

229
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:00,533
Call him.

230
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,580
It's not that easy.

231
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:05,537
God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

232
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,621
No.

233
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,378
The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

234
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,091
Broke up?

235
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,970
Like a band? Like... Like the Beatles?

236
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,968
Cap and I fell out hard.

237
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,137
We're not on speaking terms.

238
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:22,096
Tony, listen to me.

239
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:24,523
Thor's gone.

240
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,396
Thanos is coming.

241
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,103
It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

242
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,693
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be

243
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,940
moving your hair, would ya?

244
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:14,114
Not at the moment, no.

245
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,648
You okay?

246
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:50,767
- Help him!  - Banner!

247
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,527
- Wong! Look alive!  - Go, go! We got it!

248
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:53,733
Friday, what am I looking at?

249
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,155
Not sure. I'm working on it.

250
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,361
Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone

251
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,658
in your back pocket, Doc!

252
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,035
Might wanna use it.

253
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,768
Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

254
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,228
Holy shit.

255
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,147
We're all gonna die!

256
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,444
There's a spaceship!

257
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,321
- What's going on?  - Oh, my God!

258
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:45,955
What's the matter with you kids?

259
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,829
You never seen a spaceship before?

260
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,430
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd Street.

261
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,506
Notify first responders.

262
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,845
Will do.

263
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,127
Hear me and rejoice.

264
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,967
You are about to die

265
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,090
at the hands of the Children of Thanos.

266
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,718
Be thankful...

267
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,429
that your meaningless lives are now contributing...

268
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,554
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.

269
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,438
You better pack it up and get outta here.

270
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,724
Stonekeeper.

271
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,027
Does this chattering animal speak for you?

272
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,900
Certainly not. I speak for myself.

273
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,778
You're trespassing in this city and on this planet.

274
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:04,242
He means get lost, Squidward.

275
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,573
He exhausts me.

276
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,700
Bring me the stone.

277
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,790
Banner, you want a piece?

278
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,160
Mmm, no, not really.

279
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,540
But when do I ever get what I want?

280
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:15,704
That's right.

281
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:17,631
Okay. Push!

282
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,257
It's been a while.

283
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,918
It's gonna be good to have you, buddy.

284
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,085
Okay. Shh.

285
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,922
Let me just... I need to concentrate here for a second.

286
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,340
Come on, come on, man.

287
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,721
God!

288
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:31,095
Where's your guy?

289
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,980
I don't know. We've sorta been having a thing.

290
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,102
- It's no time for a thing.  - I know.

291
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,733
That's the thing right there. Let's go.

292
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,112
Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

293
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,198
Tony, I'm sorry. Either I can't or he won't.

294
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,278
It's okay.

295
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,739
Hey, stand down. Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

296
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,248
- I have him.  - Damn it.

297
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,106
Where'd that come from?

298
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,316
It's nanotech.

299
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,442
You like it? A little something I...

300
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,490
Doctor Banner, if the rest of your green friend

301
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,696
won't be joining us...

302
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,623
Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

303
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,128
It stays with me.

304
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,634
Exactly. Bye.

305
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,186
Tony, you okay?

306
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:57,313
- How we doing? Good? Bad?  - Really, really good.

307
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,515
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

308
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,978
I'm trying. He won't come out.

309
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,943
Hammer.

310
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,572
Come on, Hulk! What are you doing to me?

311
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,866
Come out! Come out! Come out!

312
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,251
No!

313
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,919
What do you mean, "No"?

314
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,298
Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

315
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,263
- Kid, where'd you come from?  - A field trip to MoMA.

316
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,770
Uh, what is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

317
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:39,932
Uh, he's from space.

318
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,982
He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

319
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,469
Your powers are quaint.

320
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,297
You must be popular with children.

321
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,056
It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

322
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,186
Then I'll take it off your corpse.

323
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:37,410
You'll find removing a dead man's spell troublesome.

324
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,161
You'll only wish you were dead.

325
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,418
No!

326
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,091
Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

327
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,804
On it!

328
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:06,601
Not cool.

329
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:11,856
Gotcha!

330
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:14,610
Wait!

331
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,661
Uh, Mr. Stark, I'm being beamed up.

332
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,166
Hang on, kid.

333
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,851
Wong, you're invited to my wedding.

334
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:56,527
Give me a little juice, Friday.

335
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,873
Unlock 17A

336
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,475
Peter, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

337
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,724
But you said save the wizard!

338
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:25,138
I can't breathe.

339
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,104
We're too high up. You're running out of air.

340
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,311
Yeah. That makes sense.

341
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,497
Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

342
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,710
Happy trails, kid.

343
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,211
- Friday, send him home.  - Yep.

344
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:55,635
Oh, come on!

345
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,055
Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

346
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,221
Tony? Oh, my God.

347
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,306
Are you all right? What's going on?

348
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:09,770
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think

349
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,146
we might have to push our 8:30 res.

350
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,317
Why?

351
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,895
Just 'cause I'll probably

352
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,400
not make it back for a while.

353
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,733
Tell me you're not on that ship.

354
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,816
Yeah.

355
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,243
God, no, please tell me you're not on the ship.

356
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,994
Honey, I'm sorry.

357
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,325
I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

358
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,656
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God.

359
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,916
- Pep.  - Come back here right now.

360
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,034
Come back.

361
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,124
Boss, we're losing her.

362
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,334
I'm going too.

363
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,674
Oh, my God!

364
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,104
I shoulda stayed on the bus.

365
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,821
Where you going?

366
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,490
The Time Stone's been taken.

367
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,579
The Sanctum remains unguarded.

368
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,668
What will you do?

369
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,125
I'm gonna make a call.

370
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:54,583
Sing it, Drax!

371
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,552
Why are we doing this again?

372
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,345
It's a distress signal, Rocket.

373
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,429
Someone could be dying.

374
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,690
I get that, but why are we doing it?

375
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,646
'Cause we're nice.

376
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:16,809
And maybe whoever it is

377
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,566
will give us a little cheddar cheese for our effort.

378
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,072
- Which isn't the point.  - Which isn't the point.

379
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,948
I mean, if he doesn't pony up...

380
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,154
We take his ship.

381
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,990
Exactly! Bingo!

382
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,195
All right!

383
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,832
We are arriving.

384
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,242
All right, Guardians,

385
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:34,453
don't forget this might be dangerous...

386
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,917
so let's put on our mean faces.

387
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:43,715
Groot, put that thing away, now.

388
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,795
I don't wanna tell you again.

389
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,299
I am Groot!

390
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,382
Language!

391
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,682
You got some acorns on you, kid.

392
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,391
Ever since you got a little sap,

393
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,472
you're a total d-hole.

394
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,685
Now, keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces.

395
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,155
What happened?

396
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:12,540
Oh, my God.

397
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,872
Looks like we're not getting paid.

398
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,092
Wipers! Wipers!

399
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:25,549
Get it off.

400
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,972
How the hell is this dude still alive?

401
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,935
He is not a dude.

402
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,645
You're a dude.

403
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:42,024
This... This is a man.

404
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:45,149
A handsome, muscular man.

405
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,315
I'm muscular.

406
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,400
But who are you kidding, Quill?

407
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,860
You're one sandwich away from fat.

408
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:49,944
Yeah, right.

409
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,529
It's true, Quill. You have put on weight.

410
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,955
What?

411
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,750
Gamora, do you think I'm...

412
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,631
He is anxious, angry.

413
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,669
He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

414
00:30:06,555 --> 00:30:09,298
It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

415
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,425
This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay.

416
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,310
I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit.

417
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,470
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

418
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,938
You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

419
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,315
It's like his muscles

420
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,313
are made of Cotati metal fibers.

421
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,193
Stop massaging his muscles.

422
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,980
Wake him up.

423
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,067
Wake.

424
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,921
Who the hell are you guys?

425
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:56,345
The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal.

426
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,228
To bring balance to the universe

427
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,477
by wiping out half of all life.

428
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,609
He used to kill people planet by planet,

429
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,061
massacre by massacre.

430
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:06,730
Including my own.

431
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:08,489
If he gets all six Infinity Stones...

432
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,866
he can do it with the snap of his fingers like this.

433
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,453
You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

434
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:18,412
Gamora is the daughter of Thanos.

435
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,547
Your father killed my brother.

436
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,090
Oh, boy.

437
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,921
Stepfather, technically.

438
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,007
And she hates him as much as you do.

439
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,261
Families can be tough.

440
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,767
Before my father died,

441
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,594
he told me that I had a half-sister...

442
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,014
that he imprisoned in Hell.

443
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:44,150
And then she returned home and stabbed me in the eye.

444
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,605
So I had to kill her.

445
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,816
That's life though, isn't it, I guess.

446
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,147
Goes round and round and...

447
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:50,981
I feel your pain.

448
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,446
I feel your pain as well, because...

449
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,781
I mean, it's not a competition,

450
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,987
but I've been through a lot.

451
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,826
My father killed my mother.

452
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,115
And then I had to kill my father.

453
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,700
That was hard.

454
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,745
Probably even harder than having to kill a sister.

455
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,165
Plus, I came out with both my eyes, which was...

456
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,049
I need a hammer, not a spoon.

457
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,971
How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of, uh...

458
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:17,054
A four-digit code, maybe? Maybe a birthdate.

459
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:20,512
- Uh, what are you doing?  - Taking your pod.

460
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,018
No, you're not.

461
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:29,021
You will not be taking our pod today, sir.

462
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:32,899
Uh... Quill, are you making your voice deeper?

463
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,444
- No.  - You are.

464
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,329
You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

465
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:40,660
No, I'm not.

466
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:42,871
- He just did it again!  - This is my voice.

467
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,040
Are you mocking me?

468
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,423
- Are you mocking me?  - Stop it. You did it again.

469
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,920
He's trying to copy me.

470
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:56,005
I need you to stop doing that.

471
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,799
Enough! He's doing it first.

472
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,342
We need to stop Thanos.

473
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,055
Which means we need to find out

474
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,136
where he's going next.

475
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:03,555
Knowhere.

476
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,394
He must be going somewhere.

477
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,559
No, no. Knowhere?

478
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:10,399
It's a place. We've been there. It sucks.

479
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:12,985
- Excuse me, that's our food.  - Not anymore.

480
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,572
Thor, why would he go to Knowhere?

481
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:17,906
Because for years...

482
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,241
the Reality Stone's been safely stored there

483
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,743
with a man called the Collector.

484
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,499
If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe.

485
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,455
Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

486
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:26,911
- Or a genius.  - How do you know...

487
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,626
he's not going for one of the other stones?

488
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:32,166
There are six stones out there.

489
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,552
Thanos already has the Power Stone...

490
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,010
because he stole it last week when he decimated Xandar.

491
00:33:38,475 --> 00:33:40,512
He stole the Space Stone from me...

492
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,348
when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people.

493
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,138
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

494
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:46,222
They're with the Avengers.

495
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,808
- The Avengers?  - Earth's mightiest heroes.

496
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,101
Like Kevin Bacon?

497
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,564
He may be on the team. I don't know.

498
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:52,645
I haven't been there in a while.

499
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,030
As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that.

500
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,816
No one even knows where it is.

501
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,734
Therefore Thanos can't get it.

502
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,285
Therefore he's going to Knowhere.

503
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,868
Hence he'll be getting the Reality Stone.

504
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,077
You're welcome.

505
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:05,458
Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

506
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:09,291
Wrong. Where we have to go is Nidavellir.

507
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,588
- That's a made  - up world.  - All words are made up.

508
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,842
Nidavellir is real? Seriously?

509
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,627
That place is a legend.

510
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:18,216
They make the most powerful, horrific weapons

511
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,343
to ever torment the universe.

512
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,554
I would very much like to go there, please.

513
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,717
The rabbit is correct

514
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,802
and clearly the smartest among you.

515
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,974
Rabbit?

516
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,389
Only Eitri the Dwarf can make me the weapon I need.

517
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,774
I assume you're the captain, sir.

518
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:30,933
You're very perceptive.

519
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,318
You seem like a noble leader.

520
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:33,986
Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

521
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,943
Let me just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me!

522
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,858
- Yeah. I'll go.  - Wonderful!

523
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,151
Uh, except for that I'm the captain.

524
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:41,235
Quiet.

525
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,911
- That's my backpack.  - Go sit down.

526
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,697
Look, this is my ship.

527
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,615
And I'm not goin' to...

528
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,710
Wait, what kinda weapon are we talkin' about here?

529
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,120
The Thanos-killing kind.

530
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,456
Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

531
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,670
No. You simply lack the strength to wield them.

532
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:56,925
Your bodies would crumble

533
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,173
as your minds collapsed into madness.

534
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,258
Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

535
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,593
Mmm, a little bit, yeah.

536
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,007
If we don't go to Knowhere

537
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,683
and Thanos retrieves another stone...

538
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,389
he'll be too powerful to stop.

539
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,725
- He already is.  - I got it figured out.

540
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,605
We got two ships

541
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,058
and a large assortment of morons.

542
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,478
So me and Groot will go with the pirate angel here.

543
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,816
And the morons will go to Knowhere

544
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,488
to try to stop Thanos.

545
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,570
- Cool? Cool.  - So cool.

546
00:35:20,744 --> 00:35:22,030
For the record...

547
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,119
I know that you're going with him

548
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,286
because it's where Thanos isn't.

549
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,948
You know, you really shouldn't

550
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,159
talk that way to your captain, Quill.

551
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,460
Come on, Groot.

552
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,713
Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.

553
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:41,262
I bid you farewell and good luck, morons.

554
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,547
Bye.

555
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:58,438
Vis?

556
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:00,819
Is it the stone again?

557
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,608
It's as if it's speaking to me.

558
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,951
What does it say?

559
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,205
I don't... I don't know, but something.

560
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,005
Tell me what you feel.

561
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,730
I just feel you.

562
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,820
So there's a 10:00 A. M. To Glasgow...

563
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:45,985
which would give us more time together before you went back.

564
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,619
What if I miss that train?

565
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:48,779
There's an 11:00.

566
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,370
What if I missed all the trains?

567
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,459
What if this time I didn't go back?

568
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,961
But you gave Stark your word.

569
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:57,292
I'd rather give it to you.

570
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,422
Well, there are people who are expecting me too, you know.

571
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,924
We both made promises.

572
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,801
Not to each other.

573
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,211
Wanda.

574
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,514
For two years, we've stolen these moments...

575
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,721
trying to see if this could work and...

576
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,476
I don't know.

577
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,603
You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself.

578
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,477
I think...

579
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,731
- It works.  - It works.

580
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,187
It works.

581
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,896
Stay.

582
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,486
Stay with me.

583
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,490
Or not. If I'm overstepping...

584
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:41,290
What are they?

585
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,047
What the stone was warning me about.

586
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:55,354
I have to go.

587
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,430
No, Vision.

588
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,307
Vision, if that's true,

589
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:01,189
then maybe going isn't the best idea.

590
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,319
Wanda, I...

591
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,527
Vision!

592
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,349
The blade, it stopped me from phasing.

593
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,230
- Is that even possible?  - It isn't supposed to be.

594
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,025
My systems are failing.

595
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,609
I'm beginning to think we should have stayed in bed.

596
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,366
Vis!

597
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,621
Give up the stone, and she lives.

598
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:40,959
Hands off.

599
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,010
Come on. Come on.

600
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,974
Come on, you gotta get up.

601
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:02,356
You gotta get up. Come on. Hey.

602
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,854
Hey. We have to go.

603
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,362
Please. Please leave.

604
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,277
You asked me to stay.

605
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,696
- I'm staying.  - Please.

606
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,606
- Get up.  - I can't.

607
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,484
We don't wanna kill you, but we will.

608
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,816
You'll never get the chance again.

609
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,333
Can you stand?

610
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,506
Thank you, Captain.

611
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,840
Let's get you on the jet.

612
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:07,227
Now, I thought we had a deal.

613
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,110
Stay close, check in, don't take any chances.

614
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:12,611
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,567
We just wanted time.

616
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,526
Where to, Cap?

617
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,863
Home.

618
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,498
We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

619
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,107
Zehobereians.

620
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,021
Mother! Where's my mother?

621
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,531
Choose a side or die.

622
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,157
Mother!

623
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,489
One side is a revelation...

624
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:04,700
the other an honor known only to a few.

625
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,082
What's wrong, little one?

626
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,124
My mother. Where is my mother?

627
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,134
What's your name?

628
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,133
Gamora.

629
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,757
You're quite the fighter, Gamora.

630
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,300
Come.

631
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:26,676
Let me help you.

632
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:41,317
Look.

633
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,659
Pretty, isn't it?

634
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,875
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.

635
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:54,789
Too much to one side or the other...

636
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:01,637
Here. You try.

637
00:44:05,393 --> 00:44:08,477
Now, go in peace to meet your maker.

638
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,270
Concentrate.

639
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:21,027
There. You've got it.

640
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:31,624
Gamora.

641
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:33,793
Do you know if these grenades

642
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,042
are the blow-off-your-junk kind or the gas kind?

643
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,296
Because I was thinking about

644
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,965
hanging a couple on my belt right here.

645
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,132
But I don't want to if they're the...

646
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,460
I need to ask a favor.

647
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,720
Yeah, sure.

648
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,347
One way or another,

649
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,676
the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

650
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:51,929
Which is what the grenades are for.

651
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:55,190
Uh, I'm sorry. What's the favor?

652
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:58,518
If things go wrong...

653
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:02,276
If Thanos gets me...

654
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,786
I want you to promise me...

655
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:10,948
you'll kill me.

656
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:12,699
What?

657
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,247
I know something he doesn't.

658
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,009
And if he finds it out,

659
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,461
the entire universe could be at risk.

660
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,220
What do you know?

661
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,427
If I tell you, you'd know too.

662
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:33,311
If it's so important...

663
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:34,471
shouldn't I?

664
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:35,814
Only if you wanna die.

665
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,565
Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

666
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:39,976
Just...

667
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:45,399
Trust me. And possibly kill me.

668
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:47,909
I mean, I'd like to.

669
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,911
I really would. But you...

670
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:51,288
Swear to me.

671
00:45:54,794 --> 00:45:57,081
Swear to me on your mother.

672
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,085
Okay.

673
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,301
Okay.

674
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:29,572
- Oh.  - Dude.

675
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:31,198
How long have you been standing there?

676
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,279
An hour.

677
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,073
An hour?

678
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,911
Are you serious?

679
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:38,247
I've mastered the ability

680
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:41,000
of standing so incredibly still...

681
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,799
that I become invisible to the eye.

682
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,418
Watch.

683
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,931
You're eating a zarg-nut.

684
00:46:52,393 --> 00:46:53,804
But my movement...

685
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,261
was so slow...

686
00:46:57,106 --> 00:46:58,938
that it's imperceptible.

687
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,098
Mmm, no.

688
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,525
I'm sure I'm invisible.

689
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,856
Hi, Drax.

690
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,564
Damn it.

691
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:28,811
This place looks deserted.

692
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:32,131
I'm reading movement in the third quadrant.

693
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,220
Yep, I'm picking that up too.

694
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,101
Let's put down right here.

695
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,402
I don't have it.

696
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,243
Everyone in the galaxy knows

697
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,741
you'd sell your own brother...

698
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:57,531
if you thought it would add even the slightest trinket...

699
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,620
to your pathetic collection.

700
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,839
I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan.

701
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:14,264
Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.

702
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,102
I told you.

703
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,887
I sold it.

704
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,768
Why would I lie?

705
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:28,153
I imagine it's like breathing for you.

706
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,696
Like suicide.

707
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,357
You do understand.

708
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,320
Not even you would surrender something so precious.

709
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:37,863
I didn't know what it was.

710
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,832
Then you're more of a fool than I took you for.

711
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,200
It's him.

712
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,835
Last chance, Charlatan.

713
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:47,338
Where's the stone?

714
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,498
Today...

715
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:49,916
Drax. Drax.

716
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,051
He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

717
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,174
Drax, wait.

718
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,048
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

719
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:57,466
Drax.

720
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,597
Drax, Drax, Drax. Listen to me.

721
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,016
He doesn't have the stone yet.

722
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,809
If we get it, then we can stop him.

723
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,818
We have to get the stone first. Yeah.

724
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,072
No.

725
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:16,280
No. For Ovette, for Camaria.

726
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,031
Sleep.

727
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:30,957
Okay.

728
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:35,220
Gamora, Mantis, you go right.

729
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,840
The other right.

730
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,873
Why?

731
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,971
Why you, daughter?

732
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,565
That was quick.

733
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:48,244
Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

734
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,297
Is that sadness I sense in you, daughter?

735
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,920
In my heart, I knew you still cared.

736
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:09,556
But one never knows for sure.

737
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,618
Reality is often disappointing.

738
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,032
That is, it was.

739
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,452
Now...

740
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,252
reality can be whatever I want.

741
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,259
You knew I'd come.

742
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:40,045
I counted on it.

743
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:43,761
There's something we need to discuss, little one.

744
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,104
Thanos!

745
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,734
No!

746
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,702
Let her go, Grimace.

747
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:06,154
Peter.

748
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:08,866
I told you to go right.

749
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,826
Now? Really?

750
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,414
You let her go!

751
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,545
Ah, the boyfriend.

752
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:15,705
No.

753
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,044
Like to think of myself

754
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:19,592
more as a Titan-killing, long-term booty call.

755
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:21,799
- Let her go.  - Peter.

756
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:26,683
I'm gonna blow that nutsack of a chin right off your face.

757
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,760
Not him.

758
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:42,949
You promised. You promised.

759
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,329
Oh, daughter.

760
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:51,283
You expect too much from him.

761
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,462
She's asked, hasn't she?

762
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,417
Do it.

763
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,179
Do it!

764
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:17,354
I told you to go right.

765
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,280
I love you more than anything.

766
00:53:25,411 --> 00:53:26,902
I love you too.

767
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,254
I like him.

768
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,915
Still no word from Vision?

769
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,660
Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

770
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,333
On a stolen Quinjet

771
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,210
with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

772
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,257
You know they're only criminals because

773
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,834
you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

774
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,128
My God, Rhodes.

775
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:29,514
Your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

776
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,799
If it weren't for those Accords,

777
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:32,259
Vision would've been right here.

778
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,229
I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

779
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:37,722
That's right.

780
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:41,567
And I'm pretty sure I paid for that.

781
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:42,944
You have second thoughts?

782
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,820
Not anymore.

783
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,244
Mr. Secretary.

784
00:54:56,794 --> 00:54:58,456
You got some nerve.

785
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,745
I'll give you that.

786
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:02,664
You could use some of that right now.

787
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:05,751
The world's on fire.

788
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,637
And you think all is forgiven?

789
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,090
I'm not looking for forgiveness.

790
00:55:12,184 --> 00:55:14,301
And I'm way past asking permission.

791
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,308
Earth just lost her best defender.

792
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,023
So we're here to fight.

793
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,522
And if you wanna stand in our way...

794
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,442
we'll fight you too.

795
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,691
Arrest them.

796
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:33,411
All over it.

797
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,868
That's a court-martial.

798
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,329
It's great to see you, Cap.

799
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,207
You too, Rhodey.

800
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,291
Hey.

801
00:55:48,637 --> 00:55:50,924
Wow. You guys...

802
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,757
really look like crap.

803
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,516
Must've been a rough couple years.

804
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:58,349
Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

805
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,976
Uh, I think you look great.

806
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,400
Uh...

807
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:10,110
Yeah, I'm back.

808
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:12,775
Hi, Bruce.

809
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,323
Nat.

810
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,290
This is awkward.

811
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,336
So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

812
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,671
And they can clearly find us.

813
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,053
We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

814
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,804
After the whole Accords situation,

815
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,423
he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough

816
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,137
on their families. They're on house arrest.

817
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,555
- Who's Scott?  - Ant-Man.

818
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:40,186
There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?

819
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,142
Okay, look.

820
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,066
Thanos has the biggest army in the universe...

821
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:48,649
and he is not gonna stop until he gets...

822
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,526
Vision's stone.

823
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:52,941
Then we have to protect it.

824
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,734
No, we have to destroy it.

825
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,200
I've been giving a good deal of thought

826
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,280
to this entity in my head.

827
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,949
About its nature.

828
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:03,663
But also its composition.

829
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,829
I think if it were exposed

830
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:07,755
to a sufficiently powerful energy source...

831
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:11,760
something very similar to its own signature, perhaps...

832
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,509
its molecular integrity could fail.

833
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,300
Yeah, and you with it.

834
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,226
We're not having this conversation.

835
00:57:20,395 --> 00:57:22,387
Eliminating the stone is the only way

836
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,473
to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

837
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:27,233
That's too high a price.

838
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,107
Only you have the power to pay it.

839
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,409
Thanos threatens half the universe.

840
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:43,120
One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

841
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,704
But it should.

842
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,580
We don't trade lives, Vision.

843
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:50,714
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life...

844
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,671
to save how many millions of people?

845
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,881
Tell me, why is this any different?

846
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,342
Because you might have a choice.

847
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,974
Your mind is made up

848
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,427
of a complex construct of overlays.

849
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:06,188
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the stone.

850
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,099
All of them mixed together,

851
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:09,684
all of them learning from one another.

852
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:11,811
You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

853
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:15,073
I'm saying that if we take out the stone...

854
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:16,653
there's still a whole lot of Vision left.

855
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:18,200
Perhaps the best parts.

856
00:58:18,537 --> 00:58:19,869
Can we do that?

857
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,616
Not me, not here.

858
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,160
Well, you better find someone

859
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:25,412
and somewhere fast.

860
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,951
Ross isn't just gonna let you guys

861
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,252
have your old rooms back.

862
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:32,881
I know somewhere.

863
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,765
The Kingsguard

864
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:50,145
and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

865
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,854
And the Border Tribe?

866
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,902
Those that are left.

867
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,314
Send word to the Jabari as well.

868
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,574
M'Baku likes a good fight.

869
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,578
And what of this one?

870
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,323
This one may be tired of war.

871
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:08,705
But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

872
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,941
Where's the fight?

873
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:35,273
On its way.

874
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:56,256
In all the time I've served Thanos...

875
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,128
I have never failed him.

876
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:08,311
If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan...

877
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,062
with the Time Stone still attached

878
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,310
to your vaguely irritating person...

879
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:15,067
there would be judgment.

880
01:00:23,662 --> 01:00:25,198
Give me

881
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,032
the stone.

882
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,880
Wow, you're a seriously

883
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:45,055
loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

884
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,217
Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...

885
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:48,801
What the...

886
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,720
- I know what you're gonna say.  - You should not be here.

887
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,933
- I was gonna go home.  - I don't wanna hear it.

888
01:00:52,107 --> 01:00:53,097
But it was such a long way down and I just thought

889
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,432
- about you on the way...  - And now I gotta hear it.

890
01:00:54,526 --> 01:00:55,516
and kinda stuck to the side of the ship.

891
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,731
And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way.

892
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:58,894
God damn it.

893
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,860
So, if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

894
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,365
- What did you just say?  - I take that back.

895
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,821
And now, I'm here in space.

896
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:07,408
Yeah, right where I didn't want you to be.

897
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,664
This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip.

898
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:11,074
This is a one-way ticket.

899
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:12,704
You hear me? Don't pretend you thought this through.

900
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:13,784
No, I did think this through.

901
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:15,495
You could not have possibly thought this through.

902
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,163
You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man...

903
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,922
if there's no neighborhood.

904
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,210
Okay, that didn't really make sense,

905
01:01:22,304 --> 01:01:23,636
but you know what I'm trying to say.

906
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,633
Come on. We got a situation.

907
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,634
See him down there? He's in trouble.

908
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,719
What's your plan?

909
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,974
Go.

910
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,059
Okay, okay... Uh...

911
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,567
Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

912
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,365
Painful, aren't they?

913
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,119
They were originally designed for microsurgery.

914
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,871
And any one of them...

915
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,170
could end your friend's life in an instant.

916
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,373
I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend.

917
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,213
Saving his life is more of a professional courtesy.

918
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,754
You've saved nothing.

919
01:02:07,641 --> 01:02:09,633
Your powers are inconsequential

920
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,933
compared to mine.

921
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:12,969
Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

922
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,322
Yes! Wait. What are those?

923
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,677
Hey, we haven't officially met.

924
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:49,054
Cool.

925
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,516
We gotta turn this ship around.

926
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,681
Yeah, now he wants to run. Great plan.

927
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:56,220
No, I want to protect the stone.

928
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:57,605
And I want you to thank me.

929
01:02:57,691 --> 01:02:59,182
Now, go ahead. I'm listening.

930
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,067
For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

931
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,479
Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

932
01:03:04,656 --> 01:03:05,646
I seriously don't know

933
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,901
how you fit your head into that helmet.

934
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:09,317
Admit it, you should've ducked out when I told you to.

935
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,985
I tried to bench you. You refused.

936
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,074
Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

937
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:14,830
And due to that fact,

938
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,248
we're now in a flying doughnut...

939
01:03:16,418 --> 01:03:18,080
billions of miles from Earth with no backup.

940
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:20,165
- I'm backup.  - No, you're a stowaway.

941
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,328
The adults are talking.

942
01:03:21,506 --> 01:03:24,089
I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here.

943
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:25,875
What is he, your ward?

944
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,042
No.

945
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:29,420
- I'm Peter, by the way.  - Doctor Strange.

946
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,304
Oh, you're using our made-up names. Um...

947
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,474
I'm Spider-Man, then.

948
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:35,927
This ship is self-correcting its course.

949
01:03:36,021 --> 01:03:37,011
Thing's on autopilot.

950
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,895
Can we control it?

951
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,977
Fly us home?

952
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,977
- Stark?  - Yeah.

953
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,396
Can you get us home?

954
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:47,814
Yeah, I heard you.

955
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,575
I'm thinking I'm not so sure we should.

956
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:53,736
Under no circumstances

957
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,368
can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos.

958
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,782
I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.

959
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,293
What? No. It's you who doesn't understand...

960
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,206
that Thanos has been inside my head for six years.

961
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,964
Since he sent an army to New York

962
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,587
and now he's back.

963
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:09,673
And I don't know what to do.

964
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,007
So I'm not so sure

965
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,884
if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his...

966
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:16,677
but you saw what they did, what they can do.

967
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,061
At least on his turf, he's not expecting it.

968
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,973
So I say we take the fight to him.

969
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:23,140
Doctor.

970
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,523
Do you concur?

971
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:31,573
All right, Stark. We go to him.

972
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,697
But you have to understand...

973
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,533
if it comes to saving you

974
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,081
or the kid or the Time Stone...

975
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:42,084
I will not hesitate to let either of you die.

976
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,585
I can't, because the universe depends on it.

977
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:50,043
Nice. Good, moral compass.

978
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,837
We're straight.

979
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:55,464
All right, kid.

980
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,804
You're an Avenger now.

981
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:36,676
I thought you might be hungry.

982
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,356
I always hated that chair.

983
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:52,609
So I've been told.

984
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:57,197
Even so, I'd hoped you'd sit in it one day.

985
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,445
I hated this room.

986
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,659
This ship.

987
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,620
I hated my life.

988
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,289
You told me that too.

989
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:14,836
Every day.

990
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,597
For almost 20 years.

991
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,558
I was a child when you took me.

992
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,726
I saved you.

993
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,268
No.

994
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,273
No. We were happy on my home planet.

995
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,609
Going to bed hungry...

996
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,823
scrounging for scraps.

997
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:42,906
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.

998
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,036
I'm the one who stopped that.

999
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,375
Do you know what's happened since then?

1000
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:49,161
The children born...

1001
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:53,165
have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies.

1002
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,584
It's a paradise.

1003
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,129
Because you murdered half the planet.

1004
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:02,133
A small price to pay for salvation.

1005
01:07:02,352 --> 01:07:03,342
You're insane.

1006
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,477
Little one, it's a simple calculus.

1007
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:08,393
This universe is finite, its resources finite.

1008
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,943
If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist.

1009
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:14,485
It needs correction.

1010
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,980
You don't know that!

1011
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:19,567
I'm the only one who knows that.

1012
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:24,576
At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it.

1013
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:27,745
For a time...

1014
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:34,040
you had that same will...

1015
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,048
as you fought by my side.

1016
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:39,966
Daughter.

1017
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:42,552
I'm not your daughter.

1018
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:47,679
Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

1019
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:49,934
And, in doing so,

1020
01:07:50,024 --> 01:07:52,232
made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy.

1021
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,984
That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

1022
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:03,869
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

1023
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,160
I am disappointed.

1024
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,417
But not because you didn't find it.

1025
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,748
But because you did.

1026
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,959
And you lied.

1027
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:37,186
Nebula.

1028
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:45,786
Don't do this.

1029
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:47,162
Some time ago,

1030
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:49,956
your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

1031
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,116
Please don't do this.

1032
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:53,497
And very nearly succeeded.

1033
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,629
So I brought her here.

1034
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:58,416
To talk.

1035
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:08,472
Stop. Stop it.

1036
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,692
I swear to you on my life.

1037
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,482
I never found the Soul Stone.

1038
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,200
Accessing memory files.

1039
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:26,702
You know what he's about to do.

1040
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,454
He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones.

1041
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:30,740
- All of them.  - He can never get them all.

1042
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:31,865
He will!

1043
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,916
He can't, Nebula.

1044
01:09:34,087 --> 01:09:36,420
Because I found the map to the Soul Stone...

1045
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,377
and I burned it to ash. I burned it.

1046
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,217
You're strong.

1047
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,257
Me.

1048
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,436
You're generous.

1049
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:55,764
Me.

1050
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:00,190
But I never taught you to lie.

1051
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:02,980
That's why you're so bad at it.

1052
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:09,741
Where is the Soul Stone?

1053
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,722
Vormir!

1054
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:47,866
The stone is on Vormir.

1055
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,367
Show me.

1056
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,792
I am Groot.

1057
01:10:56,961 --> 01:10:58,077
Tinkle in the cup.

1058
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,503
We're not looking. What's there to see?

1059
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,834
What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig before.

1060
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,089
I am Groot.

1061
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,295
Tree, pour what's in the cup

1062
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,876
out into space and go in the cup again.

1063
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:07,386
You speak Groot?

1064
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:09,342
Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

1065
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,551
I am Groot.

1066
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,717
You'll know when we're close.

1067
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:14,476
Nidavellir's forge harnesses

1068
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,770
the blazing power of a neutron star.

1069
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,601
It's the birthplace of my hammer.

1070
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,061
It's truly awesome.

1071
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:33,237
Okay, time to be the captain.

1072
01:11:38,252 --> 01:11:39,788
So, dead brother, huh?

1073
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,295
Yeah, that could be annoying.

1074
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,665
Well, he's been dead before.

1075
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,673
But, no, this time I think it really might be true.

1076
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,471
And you said your sister and your dad?

1077
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:52,927
Both dead.

1078
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:55,221
But still got a mom, though?

1079
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:56,969
Killed by a dark elf.

1080
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,136
A best friend?

1081
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,604
Stabbed through the heart.

1082
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,149
You sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

1083
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,864
Absolutely.

1084
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:13,527
Rage and vengeance, anger, loss, regret...

1085
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:15,286
they're all tremendous motivators.

1086
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:16,363
They really clear the mind.

1087
01:12:16,541 --> 01:12:18,157
So I'm good to go.

1088
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,997
Yeah, but this Thanos we're talkin' about...

1089
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:23,749
he's the toughest there is.

1090
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,960
- Well, he's never fought me.  - Yeah, he has.

1091
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,669
He's never fought me twice.

1092
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:30,043
And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

1093
01:12:30,221 --> 01:12:32,463
It better be some hammer.

1094
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:38,969
You know, I'm 1, 500 years old.

1095
01:12:39,647 --> 01:12:41,684
I've killed twice as many enemies as that.

1096
01:12:41,858 --> 01:12:43,815
And every one of them would've rather killed me,

1097
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:44,891
but none succeeded.

1098
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,483
I'm only alive because fate wants me alive.

1099
01:12:48,656 --> 01:12:51,444
Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards...

1100
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,483
and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance.

1101
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:55,448
Fate wills it so.

1102
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:58,788
And what if you're wrong?

1103
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,873
If I'm wrong, then...

1104
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,708
what more could I lose?

1105
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:21,887
I could lose a lot.

1106
01:13:21,981 --> 01:13:24,098
Me, personally, I could lose a lot.

1107
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,894
Okay.

1108
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:34,074
If fate does want you to kill that crapsack...

1109
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:35,950
you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.

1110
01:13:36,120 --> 01:13:38,112
- What's this?  - What's it look like?

1111
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,869
Some jerk lost a bet with me on Contraxia.

1112
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,289
He gave you his eye?

1113
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:43,576
No, he gave me 100 credits.

1114
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,712
I snuck into his room later that night and stole his eye.

1115
01:13:48,633 --> 01:13:49,874
Thank you, sweet rabbit.

1116
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,847
I would've washed that.

1117
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:03,395
The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...

1118
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:05,855
Hey, we're here!

1119
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:10,978
I don't think this thing works.

1120
01:14:11,155 --> 01:14:12,316
Everything seems dark.

1121
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:16,491
It ain't the eye.

1122
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:31,206
Something's wrong.

1123
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,545
The star's gone out.

1124
01:14:34,679 --> 01:14:35,965
And the rings are frozen.

1125
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,575
I hope these dwarves are better

1126
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:00,402
at forging than they are cleaning.

1127
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,250
Maybe they realized that they live

1128
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:08,747
in a junk pile in the middle of space.

1129
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,880
This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries.

1130
01:15:14,176 --> 01:15:16,793
You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

1131
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,132
Yes, why?

1132
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,342
It look anything like that?

1133
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,510
I am Groot.

1134
01:15:25,688 --> 01:15:27,179
Go back to the pod.

1135
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,229
Eitri, wait!

1136
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,227
Stop!

1137
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:36,146
Stop.

1138
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:37,856
Thor?

1139
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:42,569
What happened here?

1140
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,284
You were supposed to protect us.

1141
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:48,825
Asgard was supposed to protect us.

1142
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,211
Asgard is destroyed.

1143
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:57,301
Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

1144
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:13,059
300 dwarves lived on this ring.

1145
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:17,358
I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe.

1146
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,324
I made what he wanted.

1147
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:27,372
A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones.

1148
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,504
Then he killed everyone anyway.

1149
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,379
All except me.

1150
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:41,336
"Your life is yours, " He said.

1151
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:46,600
"But your hands are mine alone. "

1152
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,553
Eitri, this isn't about your hands.

1153
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,271
Every weapon you've ever designed,

1154
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:53,769
every axe, hammer, sword,

1155
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:56,151
it's all inside your head.

1156
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,941
Now, I know it feels like all hope is lost.

1157
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,651
Trust me, I know.

1158
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:05,828
But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

1159
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:48,615
Mantis, listen very carefully.

1160
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,997
I need you to meet me on Titan.

1161
01:17:57,548 --> 01:17:58,664
Hey, what's going on?

1162
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:00,048
I think we're here.

1163
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,675
I don't think this rig has a self-park function.

1164
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:05,966
Get your hand inside the steering gimbal.

1165
01:18:06,056 --> 01:18:07,092
Close those around it.

1166
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:09,803
- You understand?  - Yep, got it.

1167
01:18:09,977 --> 01:18:11,263
This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta

1168
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:13,015
- move at the same time.  - Okay, okay. Ready.

1169
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,650
We might wanna turn.

1170
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,060
Turn! Turn! Turn!

1171
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:51,508
You alright?

1172
01:18:52,561 --> 01:18:54,268
That was close.

1173
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,889
I owe you one.

1174
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,482
Let me just say, if aliens

1175
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,309
end up implanting eggs in my chest or something

1176
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,603
and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

1177
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:05,113
I do not want another single pop culture reference

1178
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:06,781
out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

1179
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,324
I'm trying to say that something is coming.

1180
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:16,832
Thanos!

1181
01:19:37,648 --> 01:19:39,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!

1182
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:43,609
Stay down, clown.

1183
01:19:48,826 --> 01:19:50,909
Die, blanket of death!

1184
01:19:56,834 --> 01:19:59,747
Everybody stay where you are. Chill the F out.

1185
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,955
I'm gonna ask you this one time.

1186
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:04,957
Where is Gamora?

1187
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,626
Yeah. I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

1188
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,716
I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

1189
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:12,801
Tell me where the girl is or I swear to you

1190
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:14,132
I'm gonna French fry this little freak.

1191
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,144
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and I'll blast him. Let's go!

1192
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,313
Do it, Quill! I can take it.

1193
01:20:20,482 --> 01:20:22,474
- No, he can't take it!  - She's right. You can't.

1194
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,688
Oh, yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine.

1195
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:25,898
I'll kill all three of you

1196
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,820
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself.

1197
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,980
Starting with you.

1198
01:20:29,074 --> 01:20:30,155
Wait, what, Thanos?

1199
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:32,325
All right, let me ask you this one time.

1200
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,490
What master do you serve?

1201
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:35,904
What master do I serve?

1202
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:37,455
What am I supposed to say, "Jesus"?

1203
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,365
You're from Earth.

1204
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,541
I'm not from Earth, I'm from Missouri.

1205
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:41,959
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.

1206
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,165
What are you hassling us for?

1207
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,087
So you're not with Thanos?

1208
01:20:45,549 --> 01:20:47,381
With Thanos?

1209
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,551
No, I'm here to kill Thanos.

1210
01:20:50,721 --> 01:20:52,553
He took my girl. Wait, who are you?

1211
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,097
We're the Avengers, man.

1212
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:57,471
You're the ones Thor told us about.

1213
01:20:57,644 --> 01:20:58,805
You know Thor?

1214
01:20:58,979 --> 01:21:00,060
Yeah.

1215
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:02,605
Tall guy, not that good-looking, needed saving.

1216
01:21:02,775 --> 01:21:04,437
Where is he now?

1217
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,366
This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

1218
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,750
It's a mold.

1219
01:21:23,504 --> 01:21:24,494
A king's weapon.

1220
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,797
Meant to be the greatest in Asgard.

1221
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,293
In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

1222
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:32,927
Did it have a name?

1223
01:21:34,181 --> 01:21:35,342
Stormbreaker.

1224
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:36,924
That's a bit much.

1225
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,058
So how do we make it?

1226
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,105
You'll have to restart the forge.

1227
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,275
Awaken the heart of a dying star.

1228
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,522
Rabbit, fire up the pod.

1229
01:21:56,203 --> 01:21:58,160
The hell happened to this planet?

1230
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,117
It's eight degrees off its axis.

1231
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:02,415
Gravitational pull is all over the place.

1232
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,540
Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us.

1233
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:10,123
We'll use it. All right, I have a plan.

1234
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,541
Or at least the beginnings of one.

1235
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,050
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,

1236
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:14,344
pin him down, get what we need.

1237
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:16,175
Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy.

1238
01:22:16,265 --> 01:22:17,301
We just want the gauntlet.

1239
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:20,258
Are you yawning?

1240
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:22,514
In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh?

1241
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,636
Did you hear what I said?

1242
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:26,723
I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan. "

1243
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:27,981
Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

1244
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,986
See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

1245
01:22:31,155 --> 01:22:32,646
Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

1246
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:34,405
Kick names, take ass.

1247
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,816
Yeah, that's right.

1248
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:43,873
All right, just get over here, please.

1249
01:22:44,293 --> 01:22:46,205
Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

1250
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:48,540
"Mr. Lord. " Star-Lord is fine.

1251
01:22:51,258 --> 01:22:52,544
We gotta coalesce.

1252
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:54,334
Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude.

1253
01:22:54,511 --> 01:22:56,798
Dude, don't call us plucky.

1254
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:58,133
We don't know what it means.

1255
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:01,140
All right, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan.

1256
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,768
Except it sucks, so let me do the plan

1257
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,849
and that way it might be really good.

1258
01:23:06,023 --> 01:23:07,980
Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

1259
01:23:08,150 --> 01:23:10,267
- What dance-off? - It's nothing.

1260
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:11,480
Like in "Footloose", the movie?

1261
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:13,019
Exactly like "Footloose".

1262
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,063
Is it still the greatest movie in history?

1263
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,356
It never was.

1264
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:17,569
Don't encourage this, all right?

1265
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:18,945
- Okay.  - We're getting no help

1266
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:20,618
- from Flash Gordon here.  - Flash Gordon?

1267
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,820
By the way, that's a compliment.

1268
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:23,905
Don't forget, I'm half human.

1269
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,618
So that 50% of me that's stupid

1270
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:27,825
that's 100% you.

1271
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,314
Your math is blowing my mind.

1272
01:23:29,565 --> 01:23:29,588
Excuse me.

1273
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:35,046
But does your friend often do that?

1274
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:38,757
Strange, you alright?

1275
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,102
You're back. You're alright.

1276
01:23:50,192 --> 01:23:51,979
- I.  - Hey, what was that?

1277
01:23:52,486 --> 01:23:56,150
I went forward in time to view alternate futures.

1278
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,568
To see all the possible outcomes

1279
01:23:58,659 --> 01:24:00,491
of the coming conflict.

1280
01:24:01,245 --> 01:24:02,577
How many did you see?

1281
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:04,988
14, 000, 605.

1282
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,078
How many did we win?

1283
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:14,000
One.

1284
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,897
The stone had better be up there.

1285
01:24:40,784 --> 01:24:42,821
For your sister's sake.

1286
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:08,469
Welcome, Thanos, son of Alars.

1287
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:13,807
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

1288
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,145
You know us?

1289
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:19,859
It is my curse to know all who journey here.

1290
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:22,027
Where is the Soul Stone?

1291
01:25:22,743 --> 01:25:24,405
You should know

1292
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:28,196
it extracts a terrible price.

1293
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,123
I am prepared.

1294
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:36,000
We all think that at first.

1295
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:42,839
We are all wrong.

1296
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:56,774
How is it you know this place so well?

1297
01:25:56,943 --> 01:26:01,278
A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones.

1298
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,448
I even held one in my hand.

1299
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:08,658
But it cast me out, banished me here.

1300
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:12,870
Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

1301
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,506
What you seek lies in front of you.

1302
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,589
As does what you fear.

1303
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:29,807
What's this?

1304
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:31,846
The price.

1305
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:36,640
Soul holds a special place among the Infinity Stones.

1306
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:41,736
You might say it has a certain wisdom.

1307
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,947
Tell me what it needs.

1308
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:48,656
To ensure that whoever possesses it

1309
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,367
understands its power

1310
01:26:52,332 --> 01:26:56,076
the stone demands a sacrifice.

1311
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,789
Of what?

1312
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,170
In order to take the stone,

1313
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,670
you must lose that which you love.

1314
01:27:05,595 --> 01:27:06,881
A soul...

1315
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:08,797
for a soul.

1316
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:26,864
All my life, I dreamed of a day...

1317
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:29,192
a moment...

1318
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:32,620
when you got what you deserved.

1319
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,120
And I was always so disappointed.

1320
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,171
But now...

1321
01:27:46,136 --> 01:27:49,220
You kill and torture...

1322
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,175
and you call it mercy.

1323
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,355
The universe has judged you.

1324
01:28:00,942 --> 01:28:05,403
You asked it for a prize, and it told you no.

1325
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,439
You failed.

1326
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:11,692
And do you wanna know why?

1327
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:14,494
Because you love nothing.

1328
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,823
No one.

1329
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,625
No.

1330
01:28:28,261 --> 01:28:29,251
Really?

1331
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,386
Tears?

1332
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,139
They're not for him.

1333
01:28:48,406 --> 01:28:49,613
No.

1334
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:52,528
This isn't love.

1335
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:56,074
I ignored my destiny once.

1336
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,704
I cannot do that again.

1337
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:04,579
Even for you.

1338
01:29:28,780 --> 01:29:31,147
I'm sorry, little one.

1339
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,236
No!

1340
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:16,677
Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

1341
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:18,087
I hope you're right about this.

1342
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:21,132
Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

1343
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,232
When you said we were going to open Wakanda

1344
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,362
to the rest of the world...

1345
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:41,785
this is not what I imagined.

1346
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:43,912
And what did you imagine?

1347
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:45,198
The Olympics.

1348
01:31:45,375 --> 01:31:47,116
Maybe even a Starbucks.

1349
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:02,715
Should we bow?

1350
01:32:02,892 --> 01:32:04,133
Yeah, he's a king.

1351
01:32:04,477 --> 01:32:06,469
Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.

1352
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:09,764
What are you doing?

1353
01:32:09,858 --> 01:32:11,850
Uh, we don't do that here.

1354
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:14,269
So how big of an assault should we expect?

1355
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:17,439
Uh, sir, I think you should expect quite a big assault.

1356
01:32:17,615 --> 01:32:18,605
How we looking?

1357
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:20,657
You will have my Kingsguard,

1358
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:23,703
the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

1359
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:27,577
And a semi-stable 100-year-old man.

1360
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:31,623
How you been, Buck?

1361
01:32:31,796 --> 01:32:34,914
Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

1362
01:32:48,104 --> 01:32:50,187
The structure is polymorphic.

1363
01:32:50,648 --> 01:32:53,516
Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

1364
01:32:53,943 --> 01:32:55,775
Why didn't you just reprogram

1365
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:57,979
the synapses to work collectively?

1366
01:32:59,074 --> 01:33:02,317
Because we didn't think of it.

1367
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,030
I'm sure you did your best.

1368
01:33:04,204 --> 01:33:05,411
Can you do it?

1369
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:09,620
Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here.

1370
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:12,957
One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.

1371
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:14,419
It will take time, brother.

1372
01:33:16,132 --> 01:33:17,168
How long?

1373
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,465
As long as you can give me.

1374
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:25,347
Something's entered the atmosphere.

1375
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:44,487
Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

1376
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:55,835
God, I love this place.

1377
01:33:56,005 --> 01:33:57,621
Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys.

1378
01:33:57,715 --> 01:33:59,627
We got more incoming outside the dome.

1379
01:34:18,862 --> 01:34:19,943
It's too late.

1380
01:34:20,989 --> 01:34:22,230
We need to destroy the stone now.

1381
01:34:22,824 --> 01:34:24,440
Vision, get your ass back on the table.

1382
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:25,949
We will hold them off.

1383
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:29,533
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out of his head...

1384
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:30,696
you blow it to hell.

1385
01:34:31,124 --> 01:34:32,205
I will.

1386
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:35,163
Evacuate the city. Engage all defenses.

1387
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,377
And get this man a shield.

1388
01:34:47,807 --> 01:34:48,888
I don't think

1389
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:50,091
you get the scientifics here.

1390
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:52,726
These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving...

1391
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:54,262
you're gonna need something a lot bigger

1392
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:55,391
to yank 'em loose.

1393
01:34:55,565 --> 01:34:57,602
- Leave that to me.  - Leave it to you?

1394
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,893
Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a...

1395
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:10,319
Fire the engines!

1396
01:35:27,889 --> 01:35:30,552
More power, rabbit!

1397
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,793
Well done, boy.

1398
01:36:05,593 --> 01:36:07,505
That's Nidavellir.

1399
01:36:27,573 --> 01:36:28,563
Damn it.

1400
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:30,528
"Damn it"? What's "Damn it"?

1401
01:36:30,702 --> 01:36:32,113
The mechanism is crippled.

1402
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:33,614
- What?  - With the iris closed,

1403
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:34,741
I can't heat the metal.

1404
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:36,200
How long will it take to heat it?

1405
01:36:36,666 --> 01:36:39,033
A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

1406
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,081
I'm gonna hold it open.

1407
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,371
That's suicide.

1408
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:45,961
So is facing Thanos without that axe.

1409
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:56,804
How we looking, Bruce?

1410
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:58,640
Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.

1411
01:37:01,941 --> 01:37:04,024
Wow! This is amazing, man.

1412
01:37:04,110 --> 01:37:06,022
It's like being the Hulk without actually...

1413
01:37:09,866 --> 01:37:12,074
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1414
01:37:13,578 --> 01:37:14,568
I've got two heat signatures

1415
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:15,652
breaking through the tree line.

1416
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,316
Thank you for standing with us.

1417
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:47,768
Of course, brother.

1418
01:38:08,299 --> 01:38:09,915
Where's your other friend?

1419
01:38:10,676 --> 01:38:13,043
You will pay for his life with yours.

1420
01:38:14,055 --> 01:38:16,217
Thanos will have that stone.

1421
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,473
That's not gonna happen.

1422
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:20,930
You are in Wakanda now.

1423
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:24,563
Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

1424
01:38:25,819 --> 01:38:26,885
We...

1425
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,685
have blood to spare.

1426
01:38:41,124 --> 01:38:42,660
They surrender?

1427
01:38:43,459 --> 01:38:44,449
Not exactly.

1428
01:39:11,487 --> 01:39:12,898
What the hell?

1429
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,483
Looks like we pissed her off.

1430
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:29,790
They're killing themselves.

1431
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:07,624
You see the teeth on those things?

1432
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:08,700
All right, back up, Sam.

1433
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:10,080
You're gonna get your wings singed.

1434
01:40:22,308 --> 01:40:23,719
Cap, if these things circle the perimeter

1435
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:24,845
and get in behind us...

1436
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:26,806
there's nothing between them and Vision.

1437
01:40:27,188 --> 01:40:28,929
Then we better keep 'em in front of us.

1438
01:40:29,148 --> 01:40:30,480
How do we do that?

1439
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,476
We open the barrier.

1440
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:40,858
On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

1441
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:43,068
Requesting confirmation, My King.

1442
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:44,824
You said open the barrier?

1443
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:46,204
On my signal.

1444
01:40:46,457 --> 01:40:48,323
This will be the end of Wakanda.

1445
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:53,083
Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

1446
01:41:05,935 --> 01:41:07,517
Wakanda forever!

1447
01:41:19,949 --> 01:41:20,939
Now!

1448
01:41:51,272 --> 01:41:52,683
How much longer, Shuri?

1449
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,393
I've barely begun, brother.

1450
01:41:54,567 --> 01:41:56,399
You might want to pick up the pace.

1451
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:05,317
Allfathers, give me strength.

1452
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:07,281
You understand, boy?

1453
01:42:07,455 --> 01:42:10,448
You're about to take the full force of a star.

1454
01:42:11,417 --> 01:42:12,828
It'll kill you.

1455
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,710
Only if I die.

1456
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:16,995
Yes.

1457
01:42:17,506 --> 01:42:20,249
That's what killing you means.

1458
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:50,157
Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

1459
01:43:40,631 --> 01:43:42,588
Thor! Say something. Come on.

1460
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:44,499
Thor, you okay?

1461
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,468
I think he's dying.

1462
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:53,599
He needs the axe!

1463
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:56,394
Where's the handle?

1464
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,775
Tree, help me find the handle!

1465
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,846
There's too many of 'em!

1466
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:42,667
You guys are so screwed now!

1467
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:48,040
Bring me Thanos!

1468
01:46:20,791 --> 01:46:22,282
Oh, yeah.

1469
01:46:25,421 --> 01:46:27,413
You're much more of a Thanos.

1470
01:46:29,758 --> 01:46:31,920
I take it the Maw is dead.

1471
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:36,679
This day extracts a heavy toll.

1472
01:46:38,392 --> 01:46:40,554
Still, he accomplished his mission.

1473
01:46:41,020 --> 01:46:42,511
You may regret that.

1474
01:46:43,355 --> 01:46:44,721
He brought you face-to-face

1475
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,226
with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

1476
01:46:49,403 --> 01:46:51,861
And where do you think he brought you?

1477
01:46:52,948 --> 01:46:55,656
Let me guess. Your home?

1478
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,325
It was.

1479
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:05,495
And it was beautiful.

1480
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,588
Titan was like most planets.

1481
01:47:10,758 --> 01:47:13,626
Too many mouths, not enough to go around.

1482
01:47:13,802 --> 01:47:17,045
And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

1483
01:47:18,057 --> 01:47:19,264
Genocide.

1484
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:24,060
But random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike.

1485
01:47:25,397 --> 01:47:27,559
They called me a madman.

1486
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:30,517
And what I predicted came to pass.

1487
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:35,230
Congratulations, you're a prophet.

1488
01:47:35,824 --> 01:47:37,031
I'm a survivor.

1489
01:47:37,201 --> 01:47:39,409
Who wants to murder trillions.

1490
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:43,288
With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers.

1491
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:48,543
They would all cease to exist. I call that mercy.

1492
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:52,122
And then what?

1493
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,958
I'd finally rest...

1494
01:47:55,761 --> 01:47:58,879
and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe.

1495
01:48:00,057 --> 01:48:03,596
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

1496
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:09,147
I think you'll find our will equal to yours.

1497
01:48:10,567 --> 01:48:11,557
Our?

1498
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,069
Piece of cake, Quill.

1499
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,485
Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off.

1500
01:48:59,658 --> 01:49:00,865
Boom!

1501
01:49:01,718 --> 01:49:03,826
Don't let him close his fist.

1502
01:49:08,042 --> 01:49:09,032
Magic.

1503
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:10,658
More magic.

1504
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:12,493
Magic with a kick.

1505
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:14,120
Magic with a...

1506
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:16,752
Insect!

1507
01:49:55,464 --> 01:49:56,500
You should've killed me.

1508
01:49:56,673 --> 01:49:58,380
It would've been a waste of parts!

1509
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:05,130
Where's Gamora?

1510
01:50:46,473 --> 01:50:47,509
Is he under? Don't let up.

1511
01:50:47,683 --> 01:50:50,300
Be quick. He is very strong.

1512
01:50:50,477 --> 01:50:52,514
Parker, help! Get over here.

1513
01:50:52,688 --> 01:50:55,021
She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

1514
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:01,477
We gotta open his fingers to get it off.

1515
01:51:01,655 --> 01:51:02,771
I thought you'd be hard to catch.

1516
01:51:02,865 --> 01:51:04,072
For the record, this was my plan.

1517
01:51:05,409 --> 01:51:07,116
You're not so strong now, huh?

1518
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:09,360
Where is Gamora?

1519
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:11,411
My Gamora.

1520
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:13,619
No, bullshit!

1521
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,203
Where is she?

1522
01:51:16,295 --> 01:51:17,581
He is in anguish.

1523
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:20,289
Good.

1524
01:51:20,382 --> 01:51:22,715
He... He mourns.

1525
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:26,879
What does this monster have to mourn?

1526
01:51:27,598 --> 01:51:28,679
Gamora.

1527
01:51:32,561 --> 01:51:33,551
What?

1528
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:35,470
He took her to Vormir.

1529
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,063
He came back with the Soul Stone.

1530
01:51:38,859 --> 01:51:40,350
But she didn't.

1531
01:51:42,279 --> 01:51:45,443
Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now. You understand?

1532
01:51:46,325 --> 01:51:49,784
Don't, don't. Don't engage. We almost got this off!

1533
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:52,028
Tell me she's lying.

1534
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:57,287
Asshole, tell me you didn't do it!

1535
01:51:58,754 --> 01:52:02,168
I had to.

1536
01:52:02,925 --> 01:52:04,336
No, you didn't.

1537
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:06,213
No, you didn't.

1538
01:52:10,057 --> 01:52:11,389
- No, you didn't!  - Quill!

1539
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,345
Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

1540
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:15,051
Hey, stop! Stop!

1541
01:52:15,187 --> 01:52:17,019
It's coming, it's coming. I got it, I got it!

1542
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:21,641
Oh, God.

1543
01:53:20,127 --> 01:53:23,211
Come and get some, space dogs!

1544
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:29,133
Come on! Get some! Get some!

1545
01:53:29,303 --> 01:53:31,215
Come on! Get some!

1546
01:53:31,471 --> 01:53:33,508
- How much for the gun?  - Not for sale.

1547
01:53:34,141 --> 01:53:36,007
Okay. How much for the arm?

1548
01:53:37,894 --> 01:53:39,886
Oh, I'll get that arm.

1549
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:49,770
New haircut?

1550
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:51,443
Noticed you've copied my beard.

1551
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:55,818
By the way, this is a friend of mine, Tree.

1552
01:53:56,747 --> 01:53:58,659
I am Groot.

1553
01:53:59,666 --> 01:54:01,123
I am Steve Rogers.

1554
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:23,350
Fall back! Fall back, now!

1555
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:34,490
Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

1556
01:54:35,077 --> 01:54:36,193
I'm doing it.

1557
01:55:00,102 --> 01:55:01,718
Why was she up there all this time?

1558
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:05,555
She's on the field. Take it.

1559
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:39,297
Guys, we got a Vision situation here.

1560
01:55:42,060 --> 01:55:43,426
Somebody get to Vision!

1561
01:55:44,187 --> 01:55:45,974
- I got him!  - On my way.

1562
01:55:51,361 --> 01:55:54,195
He'll die alone. As will you.

1563
01:55:54,364 --> 01:55:55,650
She's not alone.

1564
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:23,599
Oh, no, you don't.

1565
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,225
This isn't gonna be like New York, pal.

1566
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,682
This suit's already kicked the crap outta the Hulk.

1567
01:56:27,856 --> 01:56:28,846
What? No! No!

1568
01:56:32,611 --> 01:56:35,319
Guys! Vision needs backup, now!

1569
01:56:37,324 --> 01:56:38,906
Hulk? Hulk,

1570
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,904
I know you like making your entrance at the last second.

1571
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,694
Listen, this is it, man. This is the last, last second.

1572
01:56:48,168 --> 01:56:49,704
Hulk! Hulk!

1573
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:51,577
Hulk!

1574
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:54,918
No!

1575
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,834
Oh, screw you, you big, green asshole!

1576
01:56:58,011 --> 01:56:59,218
I'll do it myself!

1577
01:57:00,138 --> 01:57:01,970
Come on! Yeah!

1578
01:57:14,919 --> 01:57:15,901
See ya!

1579
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:29,949
Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

1580
01:57:41,012 --> 01:57:42,878
I thought you were formidable, machine.

1581
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:46,386
But you're dying, like any man.

1582
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:56,226
Get outta here!

1583
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:00,692
Go!

1584
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:21,088
That was really gross.

1585
01:58:48,246 --> 01:58:49,327
I thought I told you to go.

1586
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,581
We don't trade lives, Captain.

1587
01:59:04,137 --> 01:59:06,174
I got you. I got you.

1588
01:59:06,431 --> 01:59:08,423
I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names.

1589
01:59:53,687 --> 01:59:55,178
You're full of tricks, wizard.

1590
01:59:57,273 --> 02:00:00,186
Yet you never once used your greatest weapon.

1591
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:04,603
A fake.

1592
02:00:12,580 --> 02:00:16,039
You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna lose it.

1593
02:00:16,209 --> 02:00:17,370
Stark.

1594
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:18,625
You know me?

1595
02:00:19,254 --> 02:00:20,370
I do.

1596
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:24,040
You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

1597
02:00:24,968 --> 02:00:26,300
My only curse is you.

1598
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:29,878
Come on!

1599
02:00:57,834 --> 02:00:59,791
All that for a drop of blood.

1600
02:01:43,838 --> 02:01:45,625
You have my respect, Stark.

1601
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:50,509
When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive.

1602
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,100
I hope they remember you.

1603
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,020
Stop.

1604
02:02:15,328 --> 02:02:16,318
Spare his life...

1605
02:02:18,122 --> 02:02:19,863
and I will give you the stone.

1606
02:02:23,419 --> 02:02:24,705
No tricks.

1607
02:02:29,509 --> 02:02:30,499
Don't.

1608
02:03:21,936 --> 02:03:23,643
One to go.

1609
02:03:33,531 --> 02:03:34,942
Where is he?

1610
02:03:43,917 --> 02:03:45,283
Did we just lose?

1611
02:03:49,213 --> 02:03:51,125
Why would you do that?

1612
02:03:54,469 --> 02:03:56,711
We're in the endgame now.

1613
02:04:21,537 --> 02:04:24,120
Are you okay?

1614
02:04:26,084 --> 02:04:27,791
What? What is it?

1615
02:04:29,963 --> 02:04:31,079
He's here.

1616
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:45,138
Everyone, on my position. We have incoming.

1617
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:49,854
What the hell?

1618
02:05:15,383 --> 02:05:16,373
Cap.

1619
02:05:17,135 --> 02:05:18,592
That's him.

1620
02:05:20,638 --> 02:05:23,221
Eyes up. Stay sharp.

1621
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:48,788
Wanda.

1622
02:05:49,834 --> 02:05:51,120
It's time.

1623
02:05:51,294 --> 02:05:52,284
No.

1624
02:05:52,462 --> 02:05:54,670
They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can.

1625
02:05:54,839 --> 02:05:56,250
Look at me.

1626
02:05:56,424 --> 02:05:57,585
You have the power to destroy the stone.

1627
02:05:57,675 --> 02:05:58,665
Don't.

1628
02:05:58,760 --> 02:05:59,876
You must do it. Wanda, please.

1629
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:04,471
We are out of time.

1630
02:06:05,266 --> 02:06:06,382
I can't.

1631
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:07,970
Yes, you can.

1632
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:09,885
You can.

1633
02:06:11,397 --> 02:06:13,684
If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

1634
02:06:16,069 --> 02:06:17,560
It's not fair.

1635
02:06:18,780 --> 02:06:20,362
It shouldn't be you, but it is.

1636
02:06:22,325 --> 02:06:23,782
It's all right.

1637
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:26,910
You could never hurt me.

1638
02:06:35,963 --> 02:06:37,750
I just feel you.

1639
02:08:00,882 --> 02:08:01,998
It's all right.

1640
02:08:11,934 --> 02:08:13,266
It's all right.

1641
02:08:17,607 --> 02:08:18,688
I love you.

1642
02:08:48,012 --> 02:08:50,129
I understand, my child.

1643
02:08:51,682 --> 02:08:53,298
Better than anyone.

1644
02:08:54,977 --> 02:08:56,889
You could never.

1645
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:04,727
Today, I lost more than you can know.

1646
02:09:06,530 --> 02:09:09,147
But now is no time to mourn.

1647
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:15,404
Now is no time at all.

1648
02:09:38,729 --> 02:09:39,719
No!

1649
02:10:37,705 --> 02:10:39,162
I told you...

1650
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:42,373
you'd die for that.

1651
02:10:56,724 --> 02:10:58,465
You should have...

1652
02:11:01,103 --> 02:11:02,560
You should...

1653
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:08,309
You should have gone for the head.

1654
02:11:10,237 --> 02:11:11,227
No!

1655
02:11:44,647 --> 02:11:45,854
Daughter?

1656
02:11:53,489 --> 02:11:54,855
Did you do it?

1657
02:11:56,784 --> 02:11:57,774
Yes.

1658
02:12:06,210 --> 02:12:07,792
What did it cost?

1659
02:12:11,507 --> 02:12:12,998
Everything.

1660
02:12:23,269 --> 02:12:24,805
What did you do?

1661
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:27,554
What'd you do?

1662
02:12:41,203 --> 02:12:42,569
Where'd he go?

1663
02:12:45,499 --> 02:12:46,580
Thor.

1664
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:51,495
Where'd he go?

1665
02:12:51,672 --> 02:12:52,913
Steve?

1666
02:13:27,750 --> 02:13:30,037
Up, General. Up!

1667
02:13:30,628 --> 02:13:32,039
This is no place to die.

1668
02:13:47,102 --> 02:13:48,684
I am Groot.

1669
02:13:51,190 --> 02:13:53,273
No, no, no!

1670
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:56,943
Groot! No.

1671
02:14:10,376 --> 02:14:11,537
Sam!

1672
02:14:15,589 --> 02:14:17,330
Sam, where you at?

1673
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:28,767
Something's happening.

1674
02:14:40,906 --> 02:14:42,067
Quill?

1675
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:50,492
Stay, Quill.

1676
02:14:50,749 --> 02:14:51,910
Oh, man.

1677
02:14:56,088 --> 02:14:57,078
Tony.

1678
02:15:00,634 --> 02:15:03,092
There was no other way.

1679
02:15:08,767 --> 02:15:09,757
Mr. Stark?

1680
02:15:14,231 --> 02:15:15,563
I don't feel so good.

1681
02:15:17,651 --> 02:15:18,641
You're all right.

1682
02:15:18,736 --> 02:15:19,817
I don't... I don't know what's happening.

1683
02:15:19,903 --> 02:15:21,439
I don't know...

1684
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:24,279
I don't want to go.

1685
02:15:24,366 --> 02:15:26,073
I don't want to go, sir. Please.

1686
02:15:26,243 --> 02:15:28,951
Please, I don't want to go. I don't want to go.

1687
02:15:33,500 --> 02:15:34,991
I'm sorry.

1688
02:15:49,850 --> 02:15:51,307
He did it.

1689
02:16:16,085 --> 02:16:19,294
What is this? What the hell is happening?

1690
02:16:36,188 --> 02:16:37,929
Oh, God.

1691
02:27:34,220 --> 02:27:35,552
Still no word from Stark?

1692
02:27:35,722 --> 02:27:36,963
No, not yet.

1693
02:27:37,140 --> 02:27:38,426
We're watching every satellite

1694
02:27:38,516 --> 02:27:40,382
on both hemispheres, but still nothing.

1695
02:27:40,477 --> 02:27:42,434
What is it?

1696
02:27:42,604 --> 02:27:44,937
Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

1697
02:27:45,106 --> 02:27:47,018
Same energy signature as New York?

1698
02:27:47,192 --> 02:27:48,524
Ten times bigger.

1699
02:27:50,028 --> 02:27:51,144
Tell Klein we'll meet him at...

1700
02:27:51,237 --> 02:27:52,273
Nick! Nick!

1701
02:28:05,919 --> 02:28:07,205
They okay?

1702
02:28:08,213 --> 02:28:09,954
There's no one here.

1703
02:28:19,516 --> 02:28:21,007
Call Control.

1704
02:28:21,768 --> 02:28:23,054
Code red.

1705
02:28:23,728 --> 02:28:24,718
Nick.

1706
02:28:26,398 --> 02:28:27,388
Hill.

1707
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:43,491
Oh, no.

1708
02:28:45,125 --> 02:28:46,115
Mother F...
